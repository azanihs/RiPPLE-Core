# RiPPLE
Recommendation in Personalised Peer Learning Environments (RiPPLE) is an adaptive, web-based, student-facing, open-source platform that that employs exemplary techniques from the fields of machine learning, crowdsourcing, learning analytics and recommender systems to provide personalised content and learning support at scale. RiPPLE presents students with a repository of tagged multiple-choice questions and provides instant feedback in response to student answers. The repository of the questions is created in partnership with the students through the use of crowd-sourcing. RiPPLE uses studentsâ€™ responses to the questions to approximate their knowledge states. Based on their knowledge state and learning needs, each student is recommended a set of personalised questions. For students that are interested in providing learning support, seeking learning support or finding study partners, RiPPLE recommends peer learning sessions based on their availability, knowledge state and preferences.
