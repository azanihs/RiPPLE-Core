# RiPPLE
Universities continue to rapidly evolve to address the needs of diverse, growing student populations, while embracing advances in pedagogy and technology. With the revolution in big data, universities are striving to utilise their rich and complex digital data on learners towards the personalisation of education.

At The University of Queensland, we have developed an adaptive, student-facing learning platform
called RiPPLE (Recommendation in Personalised Peer Learning Environments) that provides
personalised content and learning support at scale. RiPPLE employs exemplary techniques from the fields of machine learning, crowdsourcing, learning analytics and recommender to provide the following main functionalities:
(1) Co-creation: RiPPLE empowers learners to contribute to co-creation of learning content.

(2) Knowledge tracing: RiPPLE approximates learners’ knowledge states based on their interactionswith the platform. It uses a variety of visualisations to enable learners to track their knowledge states and progress.

(3) Content recommendation: RiPPLE uses the knowledge state of learners to recommend formative exercises tailored to the needs of each individual.

(4) Peer Learning Support: RiPPLE recommends peer learning sessions based on the availability, learning preferences and needs of individuals. Students are given the opportunity to provide peer learning support, seek peer learning support or find study partners.

(5) Gamification: RiPPLE uses leaderboards and a badging system to increase student motivation and performance.

Recommendation in Personalised Peer Learning Environments (RiPPLE) is an adaptive, web-based, student-facing, open-source platform that that employs exemplary techniques from the fields of machine learning, crowdsourcing, learning analytics and recommender systems to provide personalised content and learning support at scale. RiPPLE presents students with a repository of tagged multiple-choice questions and provides instant feedback in response to student answers. The repository of the questions is created in partnership with the students through the use of crowd-sourcing. RiPPLE uses students’ responses to the questions to approximate their knowledge states. Based on their knowledge state and learning needs, each student is recommended a set of personalised questions. For students that are interested in providing learning support, seeking learning support or finding study partners, RiPPLE recommends peer learning sessions based on their availability, knowledge state and preferences.
